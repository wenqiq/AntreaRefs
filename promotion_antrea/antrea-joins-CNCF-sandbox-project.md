Today, we are excited to announce that CNCF TOC has accepted Antrea as a Sandbox project. This marks a major milestone for Project Antrea, which just released our 1.0 release. We are incredibly honored to join the ranks of other projects like Cloud Native Buildpacks, Contour, Harbor, etc. By contributing Antrea to the CNCF, our hope is that it will increase the visibility of the project, help bring new contributors on board and promote synergy with other projects hosted by the CNCF.

Originally released in November 2019, Antrea implements the Container Network Interface (CNI) and Kubernetes NetworkPolicy for Kubernetes clusters running anywhere. It’s built on Open vSwitch (OVS), the open source technology optimized for distributed, multi-layer switching performance. Due to the highly extensible architecture in OVS, Project Antrea quickly added new features while gaining significant traction with contributions and interoperability support from both the user and the partner communities.

Antrea would simply not be where it is today if it wasn’t for the  community’s engagement through issues, pull requests, discussions, code, documentation and many other contributions. 
If you’re not already familiar with Antrea, now’s a great time to take a look. 
With version 1.0 newly released, you can test out the latest features and imagine new possibilities for the next release. 

The Antrea project team welcomes you to contribute some code, take it for a spin and test interoperability. 
We’re looking forward, in the coming months to engaging with new community members in lively 
debates about technical merits of additional features that will 
shape the future of container networking and network policy in Kubernetes.


To get started, visit Antrea.io, read the documentation or try out a demo.
Visit the Antrea Github page. We have several issues tagged #goodfirstissue
Join the Kubernetes Slack and look for the #antrea channel
Attend Antrea Community Meetings every two weeks on Tuesday at 5AM UTC (9PM PDT, 6AM CET, 10.30AM IST, 1PM China)
Join Antrea maintainers on May 5th at 8:00am PDT on a New Stack livestream during KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 to hear what’s next for Antrea and how you can get involved.

A special thanks to the community members that have gotten us to where we are and supported us along the way – too many to list here. 
We’d also like to extend our deepest gratitude to the TOC members who sponsored our proposal and guided our community through the approval process.

Quan is a Staff Engineer at VMware and a maintainer for Project Antrea. Quan is experienced in container technology and networking, and has been working on VMware container networking projects. Quan is also an active contributor to Kubernetes.

Salvatore Orlando
Salvatore is a maintainer of the Antrea project and has been involved for over 10 years with networking for virtualized and containerized infrastructures, focusing on Kubernetes in the past few years. Previously to Kubernetes, he was a maintainer for the Openstack Neutron project, for which he was responsible for overseeing API design and evolution. He is also involved in projects for integrating VMware NSX with Kubernetes and Openstack.



The CNCF Sandbox has four goals:

Encourage public visibility of experiments or other early work that can add value to the CNCF mission and build the ingredients of a successful Incubation-level project.
Facilitate alignment with existing projects if (and only if) this is desired.
Nurture projects (e.g., via CNCF Service Desk requests).
Remove possible legal and governance obstacles to adoption and contribution by ensuring all projects adhere to CNCF legal, code of conduct, and IP policy requirements.
When we say that Sandbox projects are “early stage,” this covers the following examples:

New projects that are designed to extend one or more CNCF projects with functionality or interoperability libraries. In the case of Kubernetes, the Sandbox is intended as a home for projects that would previously have started in the Kubernetes Incubator.
Independent projects that fit the CNCF mission and provide the potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need).
Projects commissioned or sanctioned by the CNCF, including initial code for CNCF WG collaborations, and “experimental” projects.
Any project that realistically intends to join CNCF Incubation in future and wishes to lay the foundations for that.
